    <desc>This is a little example of a super simple SVG file. SVG stands for Scaleable Vector Graphics, 
        and it's a form of XML that works with X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) coordinates to draw shapes, lines, or paths on a screen.</desc>
    <g>
            <!--The "g" element lets us *group* stuff together. We can use a transform attribute to 
            alter the format of things inside. We'll use transform="translate(x, y)" a lot. -->
        
        <line x1="20" x2="220" y1="20" y2="20" stroke="green" stroke-width="4"/>
        <circle cx="0" cy="0" r="50" stroke="red" fill="purple" stroke-width="6" fill-opacity="30%"/>
<!--SVG elements that I draw after this point, if they're drawn over the same area as the circle (between 0,0 and 0,50), will show up on top of it.
        We can adjust transparency for superimposed shapes by using @opacity on the <g> element (for all elements in the group), or by putting 
        @fill-opacity on individual shape elements and using a percent value.
