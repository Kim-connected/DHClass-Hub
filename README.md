===========

Welcome to the DH Class Hub! This has been a repository to help introduce and orient students to the GitHub collaboration environment, and accompanies the course website posted at <a href="https://newtfire.org/dh/">http://newtfire.org/dh/</a>. This repository is being archived so it is still readable for future reference. It has become the basis for shared instructional repositories in the [newtfire GitHub organization](https://github.com/newtfire) and elsewhere.  

You may still find the old welcome message to invite students to join the repo archived: [oldWelcome.md](oldWelcome.md)
